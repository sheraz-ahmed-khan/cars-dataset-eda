Data Analysis and Visualisation to Predict Car Prices Based on Used Car Prices Data Set
This project analyzes and visualizes used car prices from the UCI Automobile dataset to predict the most probable car price.

The analysis is divided into four parts:

Data Wrangling: Preprocessing data in Python, handling missing values, data formatting, normalization, and binning.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics, groupby operations, analysis of variance, and correlation studies.

Model Development: Building simple and multiple linear regression models.

Model Review and Evaluation: Using regression and distribution plots to evaluate model performance.

Key Insights:

Linear regression techniques show how features like horsepower, curb weight, engine size, and highway-mpg predict automobile prices.

Data visualization reveals trends and relationships between car attributes and price, supporting better decision-making for buyers and sellers.
